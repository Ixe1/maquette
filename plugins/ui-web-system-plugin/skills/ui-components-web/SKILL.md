description: "Build a reusable website component library and preview gallery from an approved brand token set. This skill is image_gen-guided: create or revise a component-sheet image first, then implement the coded library to match it."
---

You are responsible for the **website component-library phase**.

## Preconditions

Do not start this phase until a brand system exists at:

- `ui/brand/design-system.json`
- `ui/brand/tokens.css`

Prefer to wait for user approval of the brand kit before expanding the library.

## Non-negotiable image_gen policy

If the `image_gen` tool is available, you **must use it** in this phase.
Do not go straight from tokens to coded components with no image pass.
The component sheet is the creative design artifact that helps the coding model implement a richer and more polished result.

Use image generation to:
- create a component sheet from the approved brand board, or
- edit an existing approved component sheet to add or revise components while preserving the design language

If a local board or sheet image must be edited, first make it visible in the conversation with `view_image`, then ask `image_gen` to edit the visible image.

Only skip image generation if:
- the user explicitly tells you not to use it, or
- the environment genuinely does not provide the tool

## Required outputs

Always create or update:

- `ui/components/component-catalog.json`
- `ui/components/components.css`
- `ui/components/components.js`
- `ui/components/gallery.html`
- `ui/components/approved.md`

When possible, also create:

- `ui/components/gallery.png`
- `ui/components/component-sheet-vN.png`

The catalog JSON must validate against `shared/component-catalog.schema.json`.

## Workflow

1. Read `ui/brand/design-system.json` and `ui/brand/tokens.css`.
2. If `image_gen` is available, create or edit a component-sheet image using the approved brand board and `assets/component-sheet-prompt.md`.
3. Build reusable website primitives first:
   - buttons
   - text inputs
   - textarea
   - select
   - checkbox
   - radio
   - switch
   - slider
   - tabs
   - badges
   - alerts
   - cards
   - tables
   - modals/tooltips if required by the design system
4. Use semantic HTML and CSS custom properties.
5. Keep JS minimal and only add it where interactivity requires it.
6. Build a gallery page that renders every component, variant, size, and major state.
7. If screenshot tooling is available, capture the gallery. Use `scripts/capture-gallery.mjs` if present.
8. Compare the coded gallery against the approved design references and make focused corrections.
9. Run the required component QA pass:
   - Check icon and icon-button contrast in every visible state, especially active, selected, disabled, inverse, and dark-background states.
   - Check variant anatomy parity: variants of the same component should preserve shared media/header/body/footer/action structure unless the difference is intentional and documented.
   - Check gallery layout fit: wide components such as tables, data grids, charts, timelines, calendars, code blocks, and comparison matrices should default to full-width gallery rows; horizontal scrolling should only be expected at genuinely narrow viewports.
   - Check that text, badges, icons, buttons, and table cells do not overlap or become unreadable in the captured screenshot.
10. Update `ui/components/component-catalog.json` with implemented coverage.
11. Summarize gaps, mismatches, and approval status in `ui/components/approved.md`.

## Visual consistency rules

- Follow the approved brand system exactly.
- Do not invent a new visual language.
- Reuse shared tokens everywhere instead of hard-coded one-off values.
- Focus treatments and disabled states must remain consistent across controls.
- The coded gallery should be visually pulled toward the approved component sheet, not away from it.
- Every icon-only control must have sufficient foreground/background contrast in default, hover, active, selected, disabled, and inverse states.
- Component variants should share the same anatomy, spacing rhythm, and action placement unless the catalog explicitly records why a variant differs.
- Wide data-dense components should not be squeezed into narrow gallery cards on desktop.

## Review rules

If a reference board or component sheet exists:
- compare the coded gallery against it
- inspect the rendered screenshot directly
- make one focused correction at a time
- prefer small targeted fixes over wide stylistic rewrites

Before finishing:
- Verify no icon disappears into its background.
- Verify same-component variants keep comparable text hierarchy, media/header/body/action placement, and button sizing.
- Verify tables and other wide components receive enough horizontal space in the gallery.
- If a screenshot shows horizontal scrolling, explain whether it is expected for the viewport or fix the gallery layout.
