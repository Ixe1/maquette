# Maquette

Maquette is a Codex plugin by **Ixel** for image-guided website design-system workflows.

It is intentionally **image-guided**:
- `image_gen` is the creative design engine
- the coding model is the implementation and review engine
- screenshots of coded output are used for visual comparison and refinement

The workflow is therefore:
1. **Generate or edit a visual artifact first** with `image_gen`
2. **Inspect the generated artifact** with `view_image`
3. **Convert that artifact into machine-readable design contracts** such as JSON and CSS tokens
4. **Implement reusable HTML/CSS/JS**
5. **Render and screenshot the implementation**
6. **Compare implementation against the approved visual artifact** and iterate

This plugin includes a root workflow skill plus three focused phase skills:
- `maquette`
- `maquette-brand-kit`
- `maquette-components`
- `maquette-pages`

## Core rule

If the `image_gen` tool is available in the environment, it is **not optional** for the normal happy-path workflow.

Each phase must use it as follows unless the user explicitly asks to skip image generation or the environment genuinely lacks the tool:
- brand-kit phase -> create or edit a **brand board image**
- components phase -> create or edit a **component sheet image** before or alongside implementation
- pages phase -> create or edit a **page concept image** before implementation

After every generated or edited image, inspect the actual result with `view_image` before using it as the basis for tokens, component specs, page blueprints, or code. Do not continue from the prompt alone.

## Output philosophy

The visual artifact is the creative source and approval artifact.
The structured JSON/CSS files are the machine-readable source of truth.
The coded gallery/page screenshots are the verification artifacts.

## Example output

## How to use

Maquette can be used as a one-shot workflow or as three manual passes.

### One-shot workflow

For a new project or broad page request, invoke Maquette directly:

```text
@Maquette Make a homepage for "Northstar Metrics", a lightweight analytics product. Include a metrics overview, recent activity, and a clear signup path.
```

If brand or component artifacts are missing, Maquette should create them first, then create the requested page. Existing websites, screenshots, and code can inform the brand kit, but they do not replace the generated brand board and component sheet.

### 1. Create a brand kit

Start with `$maquette-brand-kit` and describe the company, product, audience, or aesthetic direction:

```text
$maquette-brand-kit Make a branding kit for a boutique accounting firm for creative studios.
```

This pass creates a brand board first, then turns it into design-system files such as:

```text
ui/brand/brief.md
ui/brand/design-system.json
ui/brand/tokens.css
ui/brand/approved.md
```

Review the generated brand direction and ask for revisions until it is approved.

### 2. Build the component library

After the brand kit is approved, use `$maquette-components`:

```text
$maquette-components Make a component library.
```

This pass creates a component sheet and implements reusable components, states, and a gallery from the approved brand system.

### 3. Create pages

After the component library exists, use `$maquette-pages` for each page or screen:

```text
$maquette-pages Make a homepage for the accounting firm.
```

You can also give a more detailed page brief:

```text
$maquette-pages Make a homepage with a proof-led hero, services section, client logos, founder note, pricing preview, and consultation CTA.
```

This pass creates a page concept image, implements the page with the approved brand and component references, captures screenshots when possible, and records review notes.

## Invocation

You can invoke Maquette explicitly by naming the plugin or one of its bundled skills:

```text
@Maquette make a homepage for a new SaaS product.
$maquette-brand-kit create a brand kit for an AI note-taking app.
$maquette-components build the component library from the approved brand kit.
$maquette-pages make a pricing page.
```

Use `@Maquette` or `$maquette` when you want the full staged workflow. Use the individual phase skills when you intentionally want to work on only one phase.

## Optional screenshot tooling

Maquette can use Playwright to capture coded component and page screenshots for visual review.

If your project does not already have Playwright installed, add it in the project where Maquette is generating UI files:

```sh
npm i -D playwright
npx playwright install chromium
```

The bundled capture scripts import the `playwright` package directly and launch Chromium in headless mode:

```sh
node plugins/maquette/skills/maquette-components/scripts/capture-gallery.mjs ui/components/gallery.html ui/components/gallery.png
node plugins/maquette/skills/maquette-pages/scripts/capture-page.mjs ui/pages/homepage/page.html ui/pages/homepage/page.png
```

Screenshot capture should stay headless, and every browser instance opened for capture must be closed before the workflow finishes. The bundled scripts close Chromium in a `finally` block.

If Playwright is not available, Maquette can still create the design contracts and code, but screenshot-based visual comparison becomes a manual review step.

## Installation

### Add the marketplace

Once this repository is published, add its marketplace to Codex:

```sh
codex plugin marketplace add Ixe1/maquette --ref master
```

Then restart Codex, open the plugin directory, select the Ixel marketplace, and install Maquette.

In Codex CLI, open the plugin directory with:

```text
/plugins
```

If you want a sparse checkout for the marketplace source, include both the marketplace metadata and plugin folder:

```sh
codex plugin marketplace add Ixe1/maquette --ref master --sparse .agents/plugins --sparse plugins/maquette
```

### Manual local install

For local testing, copy or clone this plugin so the plugin root is available at:

```text
~/.codex/plugins/maquette
```

On Windows, that is typically:

```text
%USERPROFILE%\.codex\plugins\maquette
```

The plugin root is the directory that contains `.codex-plugin/plugin.json`, `skills/`, and `shared/`.

Then add a personal marketplace at `~/.agents/plugins/marketplace.json`:

```json
{
  "name": "ixel",
  "interface": {
    "displayName": "Ixel"
  },
  "plugins": [
    {
      "name": "maquette",
      "source": {
        "source": "local",
        "path": "./.codex/plugins/maquette"
      },
      "policy": {
        "installation": "AVAILABLE",
        "authentication": "ON_INSTALL"
      },
      "category": "Design"
    }
  ]
}
```

Restart Codex, open the plugin directory, select the Ixel marketplace, and install Maquette.

After installation, start a new thread and invoke the full workflow with `@Maquette` or `$maquette`. Use `$maquette-brand-kit`, `$maquette-components`, or `$maquette-pages` when you intentionally want a single phase.
